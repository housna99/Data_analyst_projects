# Project Overview

# Maven Rewards Challenge
Overview

As a Sr. Marketing Analyst at Maven Cafe, I undertook the Maven Rewards Challenge to evaluate the effectiveness of various promotional offers sent to rewards members over a 30-day period. The objective was to analyze customer interactions with these offers and develop a targeted strategy for future promotional efforts.
Project Components

    Data Files:
        Offers: Details of each promotional offer.
        Customers: Information on customer profiles.
        Event: Records of customer interactions, including offer received, viewed, accepted, and transactions.

    Analysis:
        I analyzed the data to identify key customer segments and their responses to different offers.
        The analysis included correlating offer interactions with transaction data to determine the success of each promotional strategy.

Deliverables

    Report: A comprehensive summary of the findings, including key customer segments and recommendations for future promotional messaging and targeting. This report will be presented to the CMO.

Objective

The primary goal is to optimize future marketing strategies by leveraging data-driven insights from the test results. The aim is to enhance customer engagement and drive better results from promotional campaigns.
Recognition

This project is part of the Maven Rewards Challenge, with awards for the best overall entry, first-time entrants, and a fan favorite.
# AB Test 
This project involves performing A/B testing on a dataset obtained from Kaggle. The primary goal is to determine whether a new intervention (Test group) leads to a statistically significant difference in the conversion rates and other variables compared to the existing setup (Control group).
The main objectives of this project are:

    1. To explore and understand the data through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
    2. To test the hypothesis that the new intervention significantly affects the conversion rate and other variables(purchasen impressions...).
    3. To draw conclusions based on statistical analysis and make recommendations.

# Customer Churn Rate analysis
Case study from *DataCamp*; The task is to solve customer churn for a Telecom provider called Databel where I will be using a fictitious churn dataset. I will be analyzing why customers are churning and the churn rate.
This project aims to understand the reasons behind customer churn and identify strategies to reduce it. Analyzing churn involves not just calculating the churn rate but also determining the underlying causes and potential solutions. We will create calculated columns and fields, build PivotTables, and develop an eye-catching dashboard to present our findings.
# Video games Sales
Understanding the video game market is crucial for stakeholders to make informed decisions. This project utilizes a dataset of video game sales to create a Power BI dashboard that provides insights into various aspects of the industry. The analysis will cover sales trends, platform revenues, genre diversity, and publisher performance.
# LOL Game analysis
Understanding the factors that contribute to a team's success in competitive games like League of Legends is crucial for players, coaches, and analysts. This project leverages a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle to perform an in-depth analysis of team performance and identify key success factors.
