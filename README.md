Case study from *DataCamp*; The task is to solve customer churn for a Telecom provider called Databel where I will be using a fictitious churn dataset. I will be analyzing why customers are churning and the churn rate.
This project aims to understand the reasons behind customer churn and identify strategies to reduce it. Analyzing churn involves not just calculating the churn rate but also determining the underlying causes and potential solutions. We will create calculated columns and fields, build PivotTables, and develop an eye-catching dashboard to present our findings.

This project utilizes a dataset of video game sales to create a Power BI dashboard that provides insights into various aspects of the industry. The analysis will cover sales trends, platform revenues, genre diversity, and publisher performance.
